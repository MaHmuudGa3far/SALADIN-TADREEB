time, I hope it will not be long, on the subject of the strife'], ['So, we start talking about the circumstances'], ['Talking about these circumstances will take us to Kufa'], ['There was the direct beginning that created the strife'], ['Kufa was a tiring state'], ['It was a tiring state'], ['There was a lot of unrest among its people'], ['They even exhausted the great companions with them'],

of Kufa had begun their riot against the governors since the time of `Omar, may God be pleased with him'], ['And he is `Omar, meaning `Omar is who he is'], ['And their governor was Sa`d ebn Abi

him from Kufa'], ['At the request of the people of Kufa when they accused him in the famous story'], ['Likewise, he dismissed `Ammar ebn Yaser after he took over Kufa'], ['Anyway'], ['There is a beautiful book called "The Ruling of Countries in the Era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs"'], ['By Dr. Abd Al-Aziz Al-`Omari'], ['You can go back to it and look at the list of governors who took over

strong wicked person, you have his strength and he is responsible for his wickedness."'], ['The meaning of this statement is simply that, as Ebn Taymiyyah said, "The combination of strength and trustworthiness in people is rare."'], ['A person may be pious but less capable of running the country.'], ['Or he may be less pious but more capable of running the country.'], ['The issue of immorality here does not mean immorality, which is debauchery, that is, what we understand in our contemporary world in this sense'], ['But the intention is to say that there is a difference between the degree of strength and the degree of piety'], ['The important thing is that `Omar appointed Al-Mughira ebn Sho`ba, the sayer of this advice'], ['And this Al-Mughira ebn Sho`ba is known to be one of the cunning Arabs'], ['And he is counted among the four cunning Arabs'], ['Of course, power and immorality are not the idea of \u200b\u200binjustice and tyranny, but rather the selection of the

this was during the time of `Omar and with the great companions'], ['We should expect the situation to get worse in Kufa over time'], ['And with those who are less in status and position than `Omar

out simple, meaning a clash between a group of young men and one of them, a young man'], ['The important thing is that those young men killed that one'], ['And people testified that they killed him'],

He is the ultimate authority in jurispudence for the people of Iraq, as is well known.'], ['They said to him, “Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah has perished, his beard is dripping with wine.”'], ['So `Abd-Allah ebn Mas`oud said to them...'], ['Of course they wanted to provoke `Abd-Allah ebn Mas`oud and for him to rise up with them.'], ['So `Abd-Allah said to them: “We have been forbidden from spying.”'], ['That is, we do not invade people’s privacy.'], ['And we do not search for them in their homes.'], ['“We have been forbidden from spying, so if it appears to us, we will take revenge on him.”'], ['Okay, of course this response from `Abd-Allah ebn Mas`oud angered Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah'], ['He got angry with Ebn Mas`oud, because it implies acceptance of the origin of accusation.'], ['It means that, yes, Ebn Masoud seemed to agree that Al-Walid drank alcohol.'], ['So he sent to Ebn Mas`oud and rebuked him, saying:'], ['“Is it acceptable from someone like you to answer angry people with what you answered about me?”'], ['“What am I hiding?” This is only said to the suspicious one.'], ['Meaning, it\'s said that "someone who hides", to someone who commits the sin in the first place.'], ['In any case, this was a reason for anger between them.'], ['However, this accusation of alcohol continued to spread  until it became widespread.'], ['And the news of it reached `Othman in Al-Madinah Al-Monauwarah, the capital of Islam.'], ['Indeed, for this reason some of the Companions hated that Al-Waleed stays in his government of Kufa after so much talk about him'], ['While this accusation was increasing in circulation and spread, another incident occurred'], ['What is the other incident?'], ['A magician came to Kufa, a magician from Babylon in Iraq'], ['And it seems, I mean, what is understood from the narrations, that he was a new convert to Islam'], ['And he did not know that magic is forbidden as a major sin or that its punishment is death'], ['So he, as we say, set up a council or a theater, or the people of Kufa gathered around him'], ['And he began to show them his skills in magic'], ['So the matter was referred to Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah'], ['And Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah sent to `Abd-Allah ebn Mas`oud'], ['So `Abd-Allah ebn Mas`oud decided that his sentence was death, this magician'], ['That his sentence was death'], ['While they were at that, Jondob Al-Azdi rushed in, and he was the father of one of the young men who were killed also'], ['So he took his sword and went to the magician and killed him'], ['The story says that this magician made  people imagine that he is slaughtering himself with the sword and not getting affected'], ['Like what we see in our times and in circus games and so on'], ['And that he cuts a man in half and walks between the halfs, then brings him back alive again'], ["For example, he enters through the mouth of a camel and exits from it's back"], ['and so on from circus plays'], ['Of course, when Jondob al-Azdi killed the man with the sword'], ['He said, "I killed him, so let him revive himself if he is truthful."'], ['Since he can revive people, apparently that is, so let him revive himself if he is truthful'], ['And he shouted to the people, "Would you fall for ˹this˺ witchcraft, even though you can ˹clearly˺ see?” [Qor\'an 21:3]'], ['The important thing is that by killing this magician, he has transgressed against the sultan'], ['A transgression, meaning he has transgressed the right of the sultan'], ['Meaning that the implementation of the punishments is not left to the general public'], ['The implementation of the punishments is entrusted to the sultan'], ["Likewise, this magician's case may still be in doubt"], ['Because it was not made clear to him that magic is forbidden and no evidence was established against him, so the matter is still ambiguous'], ['The important thing is that Al-Waleed imprisoned him'], ['Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah imprisoned Jondob and also imprisoned him based on the opinion and advice of Ebn Mas`oud'], ['And he sent that to `Othman to consult him about it'], ['So our master `Othman ruled that he be punished (a Ta`zir class punishment) for his transgression'], ['Ta`zir is the punishment that is not stipulated and that does not reach the level of the prescribed punishment (a Hadd punishment)'], ['However, whoever carries out a correct punishment and does so in defience of the sultan, he is punished according to what the ruler sees fit'], ['And `Othman sent to the people to not carry out punishments instead of the sultan'], ['"for we punish the one who makes a mistake and discipline the one who is correct"'], ['That means if the one who carried out this punishment does it wrong, then he will be punished in retalliation'], ['And if he is right, then he will be subject to Ta`zir punishment'], ['The important thing is that Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah punished him and then set him free'], ['Other narrations state that the prison guard let him go and released him when he saw his righteousness'], ['The important thing'], ["Jondob's imprisonment and punishment were among the things that increased the anger in the hearts of these people"], ["add to them some of Jondob's familly and friends who got angry for him"], ['So a delegation from them went to Madina demanding that `Othman dismiss Al-Waleed ebn Oqbah'], ['And they raised the issue of his drinking alcohol again'], ['So `Othman scolded them and said, "You act on suspicions and make mistakes in Islam and go out..." meaning you gp out from Kufa "...without permission."'], ['And he ordered them to go back'], ['So when they returned, looks like they returned disappointed, not having achieved anything'], ['So this, meaning their return and their failure in what they wanted, increased their anger and resentment in their hearts'], ['Thus, this group became a center of strife and conspiracy.'], ['And everyone who had a grudge or had something in his heart against Al-Waleed or something against `Othman gathered to them'], ['Or even something against the entire Islamic system'], ['After that, they moved to another stage'], ['Which is, they planned to frame Al-Walid ebn `Oqbah for drinking alcohol, meaning to prove this accusation against him'], ["Some of them were able to sneak into Al-Waleed's house and steal his ring"], ['The ring was not only an ornament, but a seal, meaning that a book or a letter is sealed with it'], ['They stole his ring and went to Madinah and placed the ring in front of `Othman as evidence that Al-Waleed drinks alcohol and gets drunk and forgets about his ring'], ['And they testified against him that they saw him drinking alcohol and vomiting it'], ['From the words of the narration and its atmosphere, it is clear that `Othman was not reassured by this matter, but he ordered the implementation of the punishment'], ['He said, as long as you have seen him and witnessed him vomiting it, he did not vomit it except because he drank it'], ['So he ordered the implementation of the punishment on Al-Waleed and his removal from Kufa'], ['And our master `Ali ebn Abi Taleb took charge of flogging him'], ['Of course here is an important pause'], ['very important'], ['We say that the companion is human and that he is not infallible and that he makes mistakes'], ['That means we do not claim that Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah could not have drunk alcohol'], ['We cannot say that'], ['But we say that the accusation against him is not proven with certainty'], ['Of course, when the story is told from another perspective'], ['The narration, if we look at it from another perspective, says that Al-Waleed ebn `Oqbah drank alcohol'], ['and hid his drinking of alcohol'], ['And one day... Of course this narration is correct, it came in Muslim'], ['That one day he prayed Fajr and the traces of alcohol were still on his head, so his matter was exposed'], ['He prayed two rak`as and said, "Shall I add more?"'], ['This narration is in Sahih Muslim, meaning this was raised to `Othman'], ['But who raised this to `Othman, this is what we cannot be sure of'], ['Meaning the news arrived in this form, this is confirmed news mentioned in Sahih Muslim'], ['The other narration says that... I meant that if we look at the narration from another point of view'], ['then Al-Waleed ben Oqbah drinks alcohol, he hides his drinking of wine'], ['And one morning the wine did this to his head'], ['And that this magician was present in Kufa with the approval of Al-Waleed'], ['And perhaps he was playing in front of him as some narrations have reported'], ['Therefore, when Jondob Al-Azdi killed him, Jondob was right in this'], ['And with this he was forbidding a wrong'], ['Even if we accept that this other side of the story is correct'], ['And that al-Waleed actually committed this'], ['It is assumed that this state, the state of Kufa, will return to calmness after `Othman, may God be pleased with him, dismissed him'], ['Especially since the new governor was Sa`id ebn Al-`As'], ['Sa`id ebn al-`As was one of the valiant folk'], ['He is a man of knowledge, eloquence and clarity'], ['He was a judge of the Quraish dialect when the Companions compiled the second collection of the Qur’an during the reign of `Othman'], ['Of course, he was a knight commander in the conquests of Gorgan and Tabaristan'], ['But the problem here is that Sa`eed ebn Al-`As took over a people who had just succeeded in deposing their governor'], ['They are now a dangerous center of power'], ["They see themselves as capable of deposing the governor if he doesn't act their way"], ['Okay, this group that began with the fathers of those killed in retaliation'], ['And whoever had something against the governor or the caliph or Islam joined it'], ["It was the natural incubator in which Ibn Saba' would find his supporters"], ["Or also that Ebn Saba' brought some of his supporters and elements of his organization into this group"], ['Each of them found in the other help and support'], ['Among the most prominent names of this organization are Al-Ashtar Al-Nakh`ee, Jondob ebn `Abd-Allah, and Abo Mos`ab ebn Jaththamah'], ['Kufa was a camp for the conquerors who conquered Iraq with Sa`d ebn Abee Waqqas'], ['But a serious and significant change occurred in it'], ['So what is this change?'], ['This is what we will see, God willing, in the next episode'], ['We ask God, the Praised and Exalted, to teach us what benefits us'], ['And to benefit us with what we He has teached us'], ['And to increase our knowledge'], ["And peace be upon you and God's mercy and blessings"]];
