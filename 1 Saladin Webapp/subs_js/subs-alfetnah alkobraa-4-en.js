that have been hanging over this period'], ['In this episode we are trying to see with you the roots of discord'], ['And what is the atmosphere that prepared for it to arise in the Muslim community'], ['First of all, it should be known that our historical sources'], ['Our Islamic historical sources begin to report the events of the strife'], ['Without making an introduction or discussing the big economic or social reasons'], ['Who gave birth to this strife from her womb'], ['Because our historical sources, the way of the islamic history school'], ["is that  it's interested in covering the events themeselves"], ['and it depends for that on the method of attribution'], ['Which is the way to convey the the news without stopping to analyze the contents'], ['Or analyze the grand atmosphere that surrounded them'], ['and so this is the approved method of the Islamic history school'], ['But of course, contemporaries are very interested on stopping in front of the economic and social causes of the strife'], ['And they try to deduce it from the available historical material'], ['and in this they are influenced by the nature of the Western history school'], ['Because the Western history school has made the role of historian a combination of two things'], ['Between the collection of the material and analyzing the material to come up with a general theory or a general perception'], ['Whether in history, in sociology, or in economics'], ['The reason for this is due to the difference between the two schools'], ['The Islamic School of history and the Western School of history'], ['what interests us now from this difference'], ['is that the developement of the science of history in the Islamic civilization was based on a clear Islamic vision'], ['That is, the Muslim historian was not looking for the basic philosophical conception of life'], ['also, the history about the prophet and the rightly guided Caliphs'], ['it was a religious necessity, it was necessary for the sake of this religious necessity, to scrutinize the news'], ['because they are legislations and they are religious rulings'], ['The Islamic School of history has established a strict criticism curriculum to verify the event'], ['and it was distinguished by the tools of attribution'], ['And the sciences of criticizing the chain of transmission and the text'], ['and so these two things produced a historical method concerned with verifying the news in the first place'], ['On the contrary'], ['History in the Contemporary Western School'], ["The science of history emerged among them at a moment of the west's transition to secularism"], ['the moment the west detached itself from the church'], ['and so history in this atmosphere was one of the tools that Westerners used'], ['to try to reach a vision of life, to form a philosophical vision'], ['and sp history was an arena of conflict between many philosophies'], ['and therefore, the science of history emerged there, interested in the aspect of analysis, explanation, and interpretation'], ["It wasn't just the income of news, no"], ['a side of analysis, explanation and interpretation'], ["and they didn't have the tools to verify the historical news"], ['I mean, the effort they made was mental effort alone'], ["Because they don't have a chain of transmission, they don't have a chain of transmission"], ['nor do they have the "knowledge of men" (the men who transmitted the news)'], ['Of course, these episodes are not the place for this discussion'], ['specialized in the issue of the contrast between the two schools'], ['I mean, what are the advantages and disadvantages that emerge form each school'], ['But the point here is that the Islamic school of history'], ['was interested in showing us the weight of the historical news and its degree of authenticity and weakness'], ['But the Western historical school was interested in extracting from the news'], ['A story with complete elements and pillars'], ['and which is composed by human action and the action of social and economic'], ['and psychological, and even geographical and climatic influences'], ['I mean, if we try to explain the picture, we say...'], ['so for example, now the news channels have a correspondent who transmits the news'], ['And they have an analyst who analyzes the news'], ["The reporter's job is to provide the information with as much detail as possible"], ['and it is not his job to analyze this information'], ['But this analyst who sits on the channel or sits in his office'], ['His job is to analyze the news and make us understand what the meaning of the news is and its implications'], ['And what is its connection to previous news and what are its effects and so on'], ['The Western historical school combined these two tasks'], ['That is, it obliged the historian to the task of analysis after collection'], ['In other words, it made form every historian a philosopher'], ['And this is a word said by (Sophie de) Grouchy and Voltaire'], ['Or they both have a saying with the same meaning'], ['But the Islamic school separated these two tasks'], ["and made the historian's task limited to providing information"], ['even if he does not interpret or analyze it'], ['In any case'], ["What we've just said does not prevent, of course, the Islamic historical material from containing social and economic analyses"], ['and of course, it does not deny that historians and other scholars had efforts to form general theories from the historical material.'], ['But all of this comes incidentally, not primarily.'], ['I mean, it is similar, for example, to the fact that a journalist might analyze'], ['But his primary mission is to convey the news.'], ['Okay, this which came incidentally in our historical material.'], ['Which are the things that came incidentally'], ['which refers to economic and social atmospheres'], ['has received a great deal of focus in our contemporary era'], ['because contemporary historians and researchers have been interested in clarifying the social, economic and psychological conditions'], ['that surrounded this era'], ['The basic problem with this type of analysis'], ["Is that it's based on critical rational thinking"], ["That is, it depends on the historian's ability to represent the era"], ['And on the understanding of the era'], ['And the more time passes, the more the contemporary historian loses essential things in understanding the society he is researching'], ['Therefore, his evaluation and assessment get disturbed'], ['and his ability to capture the insinuations of the language and the peculiarities of the culture get weakened'], ['Therefore, this topic is one in which there is a wide range of interpretations and errors are many'], ['And also there is a lot of disagreement among historians in forming the general picture'], ['Well, for this reason we will find that even in the writings of contemporaries'], ['I mean even contemporary Islamists, even those with good intentions'], ['...we will find that they have a wide difference in their conclusions'], ['Social, economic and psychological analysis of the age of strife'], ['I mean, I mentioned that even contemporary Islamists who wrote with an honest and honorable purpose'], ["Some of them did not pay attention to some of it's requierements, requierements of these analyzes"], ['I will give examples in order to understand this topic'], ['An example from among the examples'], ['Some Islamic scholars state'], ["that the stop of conquests in the second half of the Caliph Othman's reign was one of the causes of the strife"], ['Because the cessation of Conquests will make people think about themselves, and he goes on to entail consequences and results'], ['While if we look at this second half of the caliphate of Othman'], ['We will see that, for example, in the year thirty of the Hijra, the invasion of Tabaristan took place'], ['And Yazdegerd, the last Khosrau of Persia, was pursued until he took refuge in Khorasan'], ['In the year thirty-one, the invasion of al-Aswadah took place, an important naval invasion'], ['Then happened the decisive conquest, the decisive invasion of Dhat al-Yawari'], ['In which the Muslims took control of the Mediterranean and became its masters'], ['and in which Yazdgerd, was killed the last Khosrau of Persia'], ['and in which Abd Allah ben Aamer made his conquests in Khorasan'], ['In the year thirty-two of the Hijra'], ['The conquest of Marv al-Marwadh took place in Khorasan'], ['And the conquest of Taliqan, Juzjan, Takharistan, and Balkh'], ['And these are regions in Afghanistan'], ['And some historians say that this year... I mean that Dhat al-Sawari was in the 34th and not in the 31st'], ['The intention here is to say that until before the outbreak of the strife, the conquests were not stopped'], ['even more, if another researcher wanted to reverse the matter'], ['And he says that the reason for the occurrence of the strife is the continuation of the conquests'], ['Perhaps this is closer to the truth because the areas where the rebellion occurred, Iraq and Egypt'], ['are the ones whose armies at that time were fighting in Khorasan and Tabaristan and Dhat al-Sawari'], ['Another example, for example, about the difference in economic and social analysis'], ['the lengthy discussion about the existence of facitons in the Islamic society that did not receive adequate education'], ['And they did not learn Islam'], ['And of course, in this matter comes the hadith...'], ['I mean, in the context of this hadith, there is talk about Jews, Christians, and non-Arabs'], ['meaning Persians and Kurds and Berbers who are the Amazighs, and others'], ['and of course,  there is some amplification and exaggeration'], ['as among those who stirred up strife against Othman there were no people from the Christians, Kurds or Berbers.'], ['No, all of them were Arabs.'], ['For example, some researchers sometimes implied or explicitly stated in their words.'], ['impying that the expansion of the conquests was a mistake.'], ['Because the expansion of the conquests introduced many elements into the Islamic community that were beyond the capacity of the Islamic community.'], ['In comprehension, education and teaching'], ['Of course, this reason contradicts the first reason, which says that the strife occurred with the cessation of conquests'], ['And sometimes you find the same researcher and the same writer placing these two reasons next to each other'], ['And he does not feel a contradiction'], ['You will also find a long discussion of the issue of generational change and that the generation has changed'], ['And of course exaggerations and overstatements occur'], ["to the point that the reader feels as if the generation of the Tabe'in (those who came after the Companions) was a coup against the generation of the Companions"], ['And that it was the opposite of the generation of the Companions'], ['Of course, the reality is not like that'], ['In the end, these causers of the strife are few among this generation'], ['And this analysis contradicts the authentic hadith'], ["In which the Prophet ﷺ says, “The best people are my generation, then those who come after them,” meaning the Followers (the Tabe'in)"], ['So this generation that we are talking about is the generation of the Followers, and it is the best generation after the companions, as the hadith states'], ['Of course, also, some people imagine that there was an international conspiracy in which Jewish, Christian, and Persian elements participated'], ['to assassinate the caliphs'], ['And some of them assert that the assassination of Omar was not planned by an individual, namely Abu Lu’lu’ah the Magian'], ['And that the assassination of Othman and Ali are also a link in this chain of conspiracy'], ['the conclusion'], ['The analyses that expanded in extracting the indirect causes'], ['Often they were strange and went far and crossed the line'], ['And this strangeness and exaggeration reveals to us an advantage of the Islamic school’s method in the science of History'], ["that it's concerned with providing the news accompanied by its chain of transmission"], ['and so it places the information like raw material in front of the researcher'], ['and it does not burden every historian with the effort of research, preference, explanation and interpretation'], ['and it does not oblige him to form the complete picture, and in fact not all people have this talent'], ['I mean the talent of collecting information and analyzes it too'], ['In these episodes, we will benefit from these sayings that came in our Islamic sources'], ['The sayings that explain the major circumstances and atmospheres which paved the way for the strife'], ['and here is a note, these sayings do not necessarily have to have been transmitted to us with a correct chain of transmission because they are an analysis'], ['Even if they are not correctly attributed to the one who said them'], ["the one who said it, or the one it's atributed to, is one of the elite of this era"], ['That is, from the elite of the first Hijri century, that is, a man who lived in that era'], ['and so he provides us with his interpretation and analysis of what happened'], ['and of course, from a historical perspective, this interpretation and analysis cannot be neglected'], ['just because it was reported from a chain of transmission that did not meet the conditions of authenticity according to the methodology of the hadith scholars'], ['...meaning we can benefit from the interpretation and analysis'], ["Even if we do not accept it's attribution to the one who is suposed to have said it"], ['Okay, one of the most important things that was reported in this regard is what al-Tabari narrated in his Taarikh (his history book)'], ['And he narrated it with a weak chain of transmission'], ['That Othman, may God be pleased with him, wrote in the first book for the public'], ['This first book for the public is more like the sermon of the caliphate'], ['meaning the first sermon that the caliph delivers when he assumes the caliphate'], ['But it is for those who do not reside in the capital'], ['I mean, of course, at that time there was no television.'], ['So he would give sermons to the people of the capital and send letters to the governors.'], ['So the first letter that Othman wrote had this important phrase in it.'], ['It is reported that he said, “The condition of this nation will turn to prejudice and distortion after the gathering of three among you.”'], ['“The plenty of goods and the growth of your children from the captives and the reading of the beduin Arabs and non-Arabs to the Quran»٠'], ['Here we find ourselves facing three matters'], ['The first matter is the plenty of goods, this is an economic change'], ['The second matter is the growth of your children from the captives, this is a social change'], ['The third matter is that beduin Arabs and non-Arabs read the Quran, and this is a knowledge matter'], ['That means even if it is not true that Othman predicted this'], ['The truth is that this change was observed in this first era'], ['and some of arranged it as one of the reasons for the strife'], ['First thing, the plenty of goods'], ['The plenty of goods, that is the abundance of money flowing into the Islamic lands from the spoils of conquests'], ['and because the authority in the Islamic nation does not hoard money'], ['Rather, it redistributes it'], ['as a consecuence; this money quickly reflects on the people'], ['The society quickly feels the wealth that the nation achieves'], ['Ibn Shabbah narrated in Tarikh al-Madinah with a sound chain of transmission on the authority of al-Hasan al-Basri'], ['Al-Hasan al-Basri was an eyewitness at that time'], ['...meaning that he saw the abundance of prosperity in the era of Othman ibn Affan'], ['Al-Hasan Al-Basri says, “I met Othman when I was just beginning to reach maturity.”'], ['meaning at the beginning of puberty.'], ['“I heard him giving a sermon, and there was not a day in which they did not distribute goods.”'], ['Money coming'], ['“It is said, O Muslims, go to your provisions"'], ['Salaries'], ['"and so they come and take it in abundance"'], ['"O Muslims, go to your clothing"'], ['Clothes'], ['"Then the garments are be brought and distributed among them"'], ['"It is said, go for butter and honey"'], ['Food'], ['Al-Hassan said "And the enemy flees" meaning the enemy is fleeing from the Muslims'], ['"And the gifts are plentiful" The gifts, salaries are many'], ['"And the relationship is good" The world is at peace, that is'], ['"And  relationships are good"'], ['"And goodness is abundant, there is no believer on earth who fears another believer"'], ['Muslims do not fear from each other'], ['Okay, so it is the nature of society that the occurrence of luxury is a sign of change'], ['Because of the competitiona and dispute and corruption of relationhsips that takes place it'], ['You know the saying narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim'], ['The Prophet ﷺ said: “I do not fear poverty for you, but I fear that the world will be made easy for you.”'], ['“As it was made easy for those who came before you.”'], ['“and so you compete for it as they competed for it, and then it will destroy you as it destroyed them"'], ['so the abundance of goods, that happened in the time of Othman'], ['The second matter, the collective change that occurred with the emergence of the new generation'], ['The generation of the sons of Muslims from captives'], ['their fathers are Arab Muslims, but their mothers are Persians or Romans or others'], ['So in this generation there is a natural influence by the mothers and the culture of the mothers and the natures of Mothers'], ['and this will stain the Arab environment with what was not in it of morals, customs and behavior'], ['And of course this will be accompanied by the fact that the generation of the Companions is in constant decline'], ['Whether by death, meaning by natural death, or by martyrdom in the conquests'], ['This brings us to the third matter, which is cultural or knowledge change'], ["That's when there are more beduin Arabs and non-Arabs who read The Quran"], ['Okay, the Bedouins understand the Holy Quran, because it is an Arabic language'], ['But they do not know what the verse was revealed for'], ['So they misunderstand'], ['And they confuse the positions of the verses and their locations and the citations from them'], ['and so Ibn Abbas explained this matter during the reign of Omar'], ['Abo Obaid Al-Qasem ben Salam narrated in the virtues of the Qor’an'], ['and Saeed ben Mansour narrated in the book of interpretation from his Sunan'], ['that Omar, may God be pleased with him, asked: “How can this nation differ when its prophet is one and its Qeblah is one?”'], ['Ebn Abbas said: “Commander of the Faithful, the Qur’an was revealed to us and we recited it.”'], ['“And we learned in which events it was revealed.”'], ['"And there will be after us people who read the Qor’an and do not know what events it was revealed"'], ['"So they will have an opinion about it, and if they have an opinion about it, they will differ"'], ['everyone will guess and will interpret it, everyone will have an opinion about it'], ['"And then if they differ, they will fight"'], ['Okay, if this is the case of the beduins who understand the language of the Qor’an but do not understand for which events it was revealed'], ["then it's going to get worse for who? The non-Arabs"], ["Because the non-Arabs, to begin with, learned the Arabic language, or didn't even learn it"], ['and so they are more likely to make mistakes in understanding the language and in understanding the implications of the revelation'], ['So we are facing three changes'], ['Economic, with the abundance of goods and the attainment of luxury'], ['Social with the emergence of a generation that derives some of its culture from their mothers from captives'], ['And in knowledge, when the understanding of the Holy Qoran decreases among its readers from the beduins and the non-Arabs'], ['Also, one of the texts that explain the environment and general atmosphere that occurred in the era of the strife, is what Al-Tabari mentioned in his Taarikh (history book)'], ['That the beginning of the strife was when Othman, may God be pleased with him, allowed whoever who wanted from the senior companions to leave Medina'], ['Of course, Omar forbade them from doing this. He wanted to have the senior companions around him and always consult them'], ['But Othman allowed them, whoever wanted to leave and reside in another place'], ['and so Al-Tabari narrates that "When Othman took over, he did not treat them as Omar used to treat them."'], ['"So they spread out in the country, and when"'], ['"and so when they saw it and saw the world and the people saw them"'], ['"Those who had neither archievements nor advantage in Islam got close to them"'], ['That means there are people who have no share in Islam'], ['So he was undistinguished among the people, so he was undistinguished'], ['"so they gathered around them and attended them"'], ['That means some people began to stick to the companions, "climbers", that is'], ['«They say: If they get to reign, we will have known them and advanced in getting closer to them and attending them”'], ['“And this was the first weakness that entered Islam”'], ['“And the first strife among the common people”'], ['So we see ourselves in this text before a social analysis of the strife or the atmosphere of the strife'], ['And this is one of the things with which we prove, of course, that our ancestors were not unaware of the idea of \u200b\u200bdelving into the indirect causes'], ['But as we said, it comes in our sources incidentally, because our sources are primarily interested in documentation, recording, and collection.'], ['Okay, here in this text we see the emergence of a group of climbers who gathered around the senior companions and stuck to them.'], ['They sought thereby to have a status with the companions.'], ['And to have a status with the people.'], ['And if the rule is transferred to these companions, then what does that mean? Then tehy would be in a position of power and close to them'], ['Indeed, the context of the strife will provide evidence for this statement'], ['I mean, how some of the people of the strife were ignorant, they had no luck in Islam'], ['But they were able to be close to some of the great companions in decisive situations'], ['And this text tells us about the danger of this category of people'], ['which is the category of climbers who are keen on closeness to people of virtue and status'], ['There are other texts that reveal to us the nature of the social, economic and psychological change that paved the way for the emergence of the strife'], ['But God willing, we continue with them in the next episode'], ['Then we will begin to follow up on the direct causes'], ['And from where did the first spark of this great strife erupt'], ['We ask God Almighty to teach us what benefits us'], ['And to benefit us with what He has teached us'], ['and that He increases our knowledge'], ['And may the peace, mercy, and blessings of God be upon you']];
