story of the Great Strife'], ['In which we try to explain the fighting that took place between the noble companions'], ['May God be pleased with them all'], ['And remove what got attached to this period of suspicions and lies'], ['In the previous episode, we talked about the first spark of the strife that started in Kufa'], ['That city that tired the companions during the reign of ‘Omar'], ['and it annoyed the great governors and the great governors became annoyed with it'], ['Like Sa‘d ebn Abi Waqqas, ‘Ammar ebn Yaser and Abu Musa al-Ash‘ari'], ['And the matter got worse during the reign of ‘Othman, may God be pleased with him'], ['And a group of Kufians got angry with their governor Al-Waleed ebn ‘Oqbah'], ['and accused him of drinking alcohol'], ['and they plotted for it until the situation ended with ‘Othman punishing him and dismissing him'], ['and appointed over them the eloquent conquering knight with competence and courage'], ['Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas'], ['okay, this group thought that it had become a center of power'], ['and that it is able to remove the governors'], ["and Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas noticed that Kufa had produced a group of people who weren't of the pioneers or the virtuous"], ['How so?'], ['Kufa was the place that the Arabs built and it was a camp for the armies of conquest'], ['and from there the armies of conquest set out to conquer the northern regions of the Euphrates Island'], ['And parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan and so on'], ['So it was a camp for the armies of conquest'], ['And thus the tribes that wanted to fight poured into it'], ['And of course, a kind of social change happened over time'], ['Because with the vast Islamic victories and with the Islamic conquests and with the flow of spoils...'], ['We mentioned that the fighting society encourages even those who are not of the people of virtue to fight'], ['Because fighting became  more of a gain than a loss'], ['The victory of the Muslims became a kind of habit'], ['Therefore, those who were seeking the spoils also joined the fighters'], ['The important thing is that Kufa, with the continuation of the conquests and their expansion'], ['And with the companions, may God be pleased with them, moving to administer advanced areas sometimes'], ['And with the people of precedence, virtue and strength beginning to spread out in the cities and states'], ['Here Kufa itself began to be controlled by men who were not people of precedence and virtue'], ['This is the first thing that Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As noticed when he was governor of Kufa'], ['So Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As sent to ‘Othman, may God be pleased with him, informing him and consulting him'], ['What should he do in this reality that Kufa has created?'], ['So ‘Othman sent to him to spend his effort in returning priority to people of precedence and the great conquerors'], ['and the people pioneers in sacrifice and fight'], ['and to make them the representants of the people, meaning to give them precedence in the councils'], ['and to make them the place of his companionship and to make them his confidants in his council'], ['and, we can say, to try to rearrange the social situation'], ['So that the people of precedence and virtue are the representants  of the people and their leaders'], ['So indeed, Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As did that'], ['...He gathered to them those who were subsequent in virtue and status'], ['But, I mean, Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As began to rearrange the situation as ‘Othman had advised him'], ['the class of the chief companions, the class of those who came after them in virtue and status'], ['And the class of people of piety and goodness'], ['So he favored them with a special council'], ['On top of his general council in which he received or in which he sat with all the people of Kufa'], ['So one of the effects of this step was that it distanced those who thought that they were a great center of power in Kufa'], ['So that increased the burning of their hearts out of spite'], ['And that made their bond stronger'], ['Meaning that their exclusion increased their unity'], ["In fact, everyone who thought they were excluded from the governor's council and his advisors resorted to them"], ['So that group began to stir up rumors and lies and to incite people'], ['But this time there was an important difference'], ['The charge now directed was not directed at the governor of Kufa, but rather was a dissaproval of the general system as a whole'], ['Here we must pause a little to explain this general system, especially in what respects money'], ['And why they were resentful about it'], ['Money was scarce during the time of the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr.'], ['And the Prophet ﷺ and Abu Bakr used to be fast in distributing it among the people.'], ['To the point that there was no treasury at that time.'], ['Meaning, there was no, in our contemporary terms, public treasury or ministry of finance, I mean, in our contemporary terms.'], ['So Abu Bakr saw that the money coming, whether from the conquests or spoils or zakat and charity'], ['He saw equality in giving, he gave all the people present in the city, and the Muslims'], ['He gave them equally'], ['So when he gave to the people, he did not differentiate between those who were early in Islam, meaning those who preceded in Islam and sacrificed and fought'], ['and those who came late among the people'], ['And he expressed this by saying: “This pension, equalilty in it is better than discrimination"٠'], ["Meaning that it's equal division is better than giving some people precedence over others"], ['‘Omar had another point of view on that'], ['He believed that there should be no equality between those who fought with the Messenger of God ﷺ at the beginning of Islam, and those who fought the Messenger of God ﷺ'], ['so ‘Omar wanted the pensions to be distributed in a gradual system'], ['In it, the people of virtue and precedence would be the ones who receive the big pays'], ['Then the finer, then the finer according to sacrifice and precedence'], ['‘Omar considered that enriching the people of precedence or virtue and piety'], ['And giving them preference in money is first of all honoring them'], ['For what they preceded and gave and struggled and sacrificed on the day when Islam was weak'], ['And it is part of the wordly reward for what they gave at that time'], ['Secondly, and this is the most important thing about the system'], ['That their piety, precedence, and virtue will lead them to spend money on charitable causes'], ['This will increase their virtue, their sovereignty, and their high status in society first'], ['And it will lead society to imitate them, so that they compete in righteousness and piety'], ['And these are things that could not happen to the same extent if he gave to everyone equally'], ['if he gave those who had recently converted to Islam and the faith had not yet taken root in their hearts, the same as he gave those who had come before'], ['That is, the idea of \u200b\u200b‘Omar was that enriching the people of precedence and virtue would create a new situation in society'], ['which would make the representants of the people the people of precedence and virtue, and thus this would affect the behavior of society'], ['Okay, when ‘Omar took over'], ['This was his point of view during the days of Abu Bakr and he applied it'], ['But something new happened during the caliphate of ‘Omar, which is the abundant flow of money'], ['Money became more, spoils and tribute'], ['Of course, the conquests expanded'], ['If the money during the days of Abu Bakr was barely enough for a pension'], ['and perhaps the point of view at that time, the point of view of Abu Bakr, is more appropriate because, by pension I mean sufficiency'], ["so it's better to equally divide it between people"], ['But the large amount of money in the days of ‘Omar exceeded this pension'], ['Okay, the second thing is that the large amount of money in the days of ‘Omar required the organization of resources and expenditures'], ['and recording them in the offices'], ['Of course, this happened during the days of ‘Omar, that he made recording offices'], ['...the offices, meaning we now have records of the people who are entitled to offers, salaries, and expenses'], ['So ‘Omar arranged the offices according to the division of the tribes'], ['In the Islamic society, every individual was affiliated with his tribe, and this tribe was registered in the office'], ['So ‘Omar relied on the division of money based on status, merit and precedence in Islam'], ['So his arrangement of the tribes was as follows'], ["He started with the Prophet's household ﷺ"], ["Then the Prophet's tribe, Bani Hashim"], ['Then the Muhajireen and Ansar'], ['and divided into their ranks in precedence and merit'], ['That means that those who witnessed Badr, for example, are not like those who witnessed Al-Hodaybeiyah'], ['And all of those are not like those who converted to Islam after the conquest (of Mecca) or in the year of the delegations (tribes delegations which came to Al-Madina to convert to Islam)'], ["and here, for those who want to delve more into this, there is a master's thesis by Dr. ‘Abd Al-Salam Mohsen Aal-‘Issa"], ['entitled "Critical Studies of Financial Narrations in the Caliphate of ‘Omar ebn Al-Khattab"'], ['The important thing'], ['‘Omar applied this policy first on himself'], ['That is, the first person whose pension was reduced was his son ‘Abd-Allah ebn ‘Omar'], ['Al-Bukhari narrated that ‘Omar, may God be pleased with him, did not give his son ‘Abd-Allah the pension of the Muhajeriin'], ['Although he is counted among the Muhajeriin'], ['And he said "his parents took him when they inmigrated"'], ['That is, he did not immigrate of his own free will but rather his father and mother carried him when they migrated'], ['and Ebn Dawud narrated with a good chain of transmission and Imam Ahmad narrated with a sound chain of transmission'], ['and of course, the giving of the goodness and correctness status, is by the two sheikhs Al-Albani and Ahmad Shaker'], ['This one in his commentary on Sunan Ebn Dawud and the other one in his commentary on Al-Musnad'], ['On the authority of ‘Omar, may God be pleased with him, that he said: “I am not more deserving of this booty than you.”'], ['"And none of us is more deserving of it than another except that we are in our positions from the Book of God, the Almighty, and the oath of the Messenger of God ﷺ"'], ['"So each man according to his precedence, each man according to his affliction, each man according to his family size, and each man according to his need"'], ['So this is the arrangement of ‘Omar, may God be pleased with him, for the people'], ['The affliction and precedence as well as the need'], ['Ahmad and Al-Bayhaqi narrated, Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Sunan Al-Kobraa'], ['And Ebn Abi Shaybah in Al-Musannaf and others with good and authentic chains of transmission'], ['That ‘Omar, may God be pleased with him, said'], ['“I will begin with my companions, the first inmigrants.”'], ['“For we were expelled from our homes unjustly and transgressively.”'], ['“Then the most honorable.” So he assigned five thousand to the witnesses of Badr from among them, and four to those who had witnessed Badr from the Ansar'], ['And for those who witnessed Ohod, three thousand'], ['He said: “And whoever hastened to migrate, the reward will hasten to him.”'], ['“And whoever is slow to migrate, the reward will go slower to him.”'], ['“So no man should blame except the resting of his mount.”'], ['The idea here is that the financial policy during the reign of ‘Omar supported those who preceeded in Islam'], ["and Dr. Akram Diaa' Al-Omari has a nice phrase, he says: “There is no doubt that the group that acquired the abundant wealth during his caliphate”"], ['“is the group that built the edifice of the Islamic nation on its shoulders”'], ['“and it is also more knowledgeable and committed to the islamic law and its objectives”'], ['“And more pious and righteous in dealing with money and making it easy to achieve social objectives through spending”'], ['"So supporting this group economically strengthens its influence in society"'], ['"And makes it more capable of enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong"'], ['Okay'], ['When it flowed, it seems, that the flow of money and its abundance during the days of ‘Omar, may God be pleased with him'], ['made ‘Omar in his last days consider that the policy of preference had achieved its goals'], ['and it was reported that he intended to make divisions equal for people in the next year’s giving by raising salaries'], ['That is, he will raise salaries and make them equal'], ['‘Omar, may God be pleased with him, stated, as was authentically reported by Al-Bayhaqi in Al-Sonan Al-Kobra'], ['And Ebn Abi Shaybah in Al-Mosannaf and others'], ['That he said, “If I live until next year, I will join the last of the people with the first of them and make them one rank.”'], ['However, may God be pleased with him, he was martyred before this was implemented'], ['So the system that was prevalent was a system of distributing money based on ranks as we explained'], ["Ranks in precedence and excellence as well as people's needs"], ['Okay, ‘Othman, may God be pleased with him, went on with what was done during the era of ‘Omar'], ['He did not change this policy and this financial policy remained as it was'], ["Okay, this matter was understood and accepted throughout the reign of Omar, and that's it, people were already subject to it"], ['Meaning, no one raised a problem about this system'], ['And it was prevalent during most of the reign of Othman, may God be pleased with him'], ['But what has happened now respecting the atmosphere of strife and tribal fanaticism has given this policy another perspective'], ['Especially for the strife heads in Kufa'], ['They did not look at this as a preference for the precedent in Islam'], ['But rather, they looked at it as a preference for Qoraysh over all the other Arab tribes'], ['And they saw that Qoraysh had become very wealthy'], ['And the rest of the tribes were deprived of this wealth, even those who participated in the conquests'], ['This matter was one of the reasons for the stir up of the strife in Kufa at the hands of this group that unites for evil'], ['and which gathers to it, and at it, the bedouin or the slave who, as al-Tabari says'], ['“those who found their speech sweet, and increased in numbers”'], ['“And the people were in decrease until evil prevailed”'], ['Some researchers believe, and among them is Dr. Khaled Al-Ghaith in his book “The Martyrdom of ‘Othman and the Battle of the Camel”'], ['That the environment may also have an effect'], ['That is, the proximity of Kufa and Basra to the people of Iraq may make them susceptible to being influenced by what may have leaked to them from the Mazdakite ideas'], ['they are the closest to, these Mazdakite ideas, are closest to communist ideas nowadays'], ['Or, what leaked to them from those who converted to Islam from the people of Iraq and this sediments stayed in them'], ['Or even from those who converted to Islam hypocritically and worked to spread these ideas and use them as a pretext'], ['This perception. The matter exploded in Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas council, who used to dedicate his council to the readers and the people of virtue and righteousness'], ['He used to make one day of his council for the public and make one day of his council for these'], ['The important thing is, in those who were kept away from his private council which was reserved for the people of virtue and righteousness'], ['They were attending his general council, because it was for all the people of Kufa'], ['And while they were in it, the conversation turned to the possessions of Talha ebn ‘Obaid Allah'], ['and his many possessions, and of course his great generosity'], ['Talha was one of the first pioneers'], ['So he had many possessions at that time'], ['And he was a great, generous man'], ['Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas said a very normal, natural comment'], ['He said, "If I had what he has, I would make your life comfortable."'], ['So a young man present in the council said that he wished that Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas had the entire coast of Kufa on the Euphrates'], ["I mean, you don't know if he is sincere in this or if it is a normal compliment to the prince"], ['Anyway, this simple word, which may have been a compliment to the prince or a praise for the prince and an acknowledgment of his honesty'], ['touched the hatred of the heads of sedition present'], ['and they interpreted it as him inciting Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas against their property'], ['and the matter quickly became entangled, they went to him and beat him and beat his father until he fainted'], ['and Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas was unable to prevent them'], ["these heads, as we said, include Al-Ashtar Al-Nakh‘i and Sa‘sa‘ah ebn Souhan, Ebn Al-Kawa', and others."], ['I mean, these names that are mentioned in the sources'], ['And a battle almost broke out between the tribes'], ['I mean, this clash in the council in which a man and his father were beaten almost sparked a battle between the tribes'], ['Had it not been that Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas was able to calm the situation down at the end of the matter'], ['and sent to ‘Othman, may God be pleased with him, to consult him, so ‘Othman urged him to calm things down as much as he could'], ['But those who ignited the sedition, after they escaped the revenge of the tribes through Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas'], ['increased their incitement, agitation and rumours until the people of Kufa wrote about them'], ['So ‘Othman ordered the exile of these leaders of sedition, who were a few dozen men.'], ['He ordered their exile from Kufa to the Levant to Mo‘awiyah ebn Abi Sufyan, because Mo‘awiyah was the governor of the Levant.'], ['When they went to Mo‘awiyah, Mo‘awiyah, may God be pleased with him, used to sit with them and discuss with them.'], ['And the sources such as al-Tabari and others detail these matters and discussions.'], ['However, Mo‘awiyah’s tone with them was a tone that ranged from calmness to severity'], ['and in the end, he belittled their matter and downgraded their importance'], ['And he sent to ‘Othman saying to him that “there is no danger from these people if there is no one else with them.”'], ['Meaning that these people, based on what he saw of their arguments, that is, they were, in terms of reason and planing and understanding, less than a danger'], ['But, that is if there is no one else with them'], ['That is why he allowed them to leave the Levant'], ['Of course, for other reasons, they feared that if they returned to Kufa, people would gloat over them'], ['They chose to go to the Euphrates Island'], ['The governor there at that time was ‘Abd Al-Rahman ebn Khaled ebn al-Walid'], ['And ‘Abd Al-Rahman ebn Khaled ebn al-Walid, as soon as he knew that these were the people of sedition, he dealt with them with severity and firmness'], ['to the point that they did not dare to speak to him as they talked to Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas or Mo‘awiyah'], ['and they showed submission and showed repentance and showed obedience'], ['And they agreed to stay with ‘Abd Al-Rahman ebn Khaled ebn Al-Walid'], ['And with this, I mean with this scene, it seemed that the sedition had subsided'], ['However, the other wing of the sedition, represented by the elements of Ebn Saba’s organization, was still operating in Kufa'], ['It entered a state of idleness  after the exile of those, but it was still working'], ["We will come in a little while to ‘Abd-Allah ebn Saba' and his organization"], ["But this other wing, which is the elements of Ebn Saba', the elements of the secret organization"], ['This state of calmness tempted the governor of Kufa, Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As, so he worked to make changes'], ['And he felt that the strife had calmed down and subsided'], ['and so he began to try to appoint some governors over the regions of Kufa, the areas affiliated with Kufa'], ['He appointed the prominent people, their notables and their dignitaries'], ['as a result the matter returned again, Kufa was emptied of the great Islamic leaderships'], ['and there remained in it none of the prominent people or the notables of the people or the leaders of the tribes except those who were "~fanatic" or "tempted", in the words of al-Tabari'], ['Then the matter returned as it was before that'], ['that the ones who have the word in Kufa are not trustworthy or reliable figures or people of virtue and precedence.'], ["Ebn Saba's organization will exploit this vacuum and a new name will emerge from the heads of strife in Kufa."], ['and he is Yazid ebn Qays.'], ['Okay, Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas went to Al-Madina and was not in Kufa.'], ['So this Yazid ebn Qays appeared, he seized this opportunity.'], ['and he organized a meeting in the Kufa Mosque'], ['more like a sit-in or more like a demonstration, in our contemporary terms'], ['He called for the removal of ‘Othman ebn ‘Affan'], ['And Ebn Saba’s organization gathered with him for that'], ['Here, Al-Qa‘qa‘ ebn Amr Al-Tamimi confronted him'], ['Al-Qa‘qa‘ ebn ‘Amr Al-Tamimi is a man not agreed upon his companionship (of the Prophet),  is he a companion or not'], ['However, he is one of the great knights of Islam, one of the great figures of conquest, and one of the great trustworthy people'], ['so Al-Qa‘qa‘ ebn ‘Amr Al-Tamimi attacked him and grabbed him'], ['Then, In that moment, he claimed that he was obedient to ‘Othman and was only demanding the removal of Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As from Kufa'], ['so Al-Qa‘qa‘ took him out of the mosque and forbade him from meeting in it'], ['And he ordered him that if he has a request, he should raise it to ‘Othman'], ['And consequently, this Yazid ebn Qais returned to his house, disappointed'], ['However, with this new situation that he created'], ['He sent to the exiled leaders of the strife, summoning them to Kufa'], ['Especially since its governor, Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas, was present in Mecca'], ['These people found it an irreplaceable opportunity and rushed to Kufa again'], ["One of these seditionists was Ashtar al-Nakha'i"], ["One of the leaders of this sedition was Ashtar al-Nakha'i"], ['He preceded these people in arriving in Kufa'], ["and then he spread a lie saying that Sa‘id ebn al-'As intended to reduce the pensions allocated to them"], ['Because Sa‘id ebn al-\'As believed that this money is the "garden of Qoraish", meaning it is the property of Qoraish'], ['And of course Sa‘id ebn Al-‘As was in Al-Madina before that'], ['So Al-Ashtar with this fanatic tribal lie he adressed them'], ['And he addressed their greed for money'], ['He addressed the tribal fanaticism of the people of fanaticism'], ['And he addressed the people with greed for money, the people of ambitions, that is, and those who do not have a tribe, for example, from the young or the freed slaves and the like'], ['Here the people became agitated and the matter got out of hand and they resolved to go out to the outskirts of Kufa and prevent Sa‘eed ebn Al-‘Aas from entering it.'], ['And indeed they went out.'], ['When Sa‘eed ebn Al-Aas arrived, he found that they had camped awaiting for him.'], ['So when he knew their request and that they wanted to depose him, he returned to Al-Madina.'], ['And this day, on which those gathered, was known as Yaum Al-Jara‘ah.'], ['And this day was mentioned In general, in Sahih Moslem'], ['When he returned to Al-Madina, ‘Othman asked him, “What do they want?
